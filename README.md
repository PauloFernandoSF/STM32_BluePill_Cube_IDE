# STM32_BluePill_Cube_IDE
Examples of codes developed in Cube IDE for the Blue Pill(STM32F103C8T6) board.
To be able to program and build code for STM32 devices, you have to:
  - Download and install CubeIDE, to build code -> https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html
  - Download and install STM32CubeProgrammer to program the chip -> https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html
  - Buy Stlink in-circuit debugger and programmer for the STM32 microcontrollers. This is the model that I use ->
